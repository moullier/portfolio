# Portfolio - Maria Francis-Moullier

## Description

This webpage consists of three HTML files with CSS styling in a separate CSS file.  It is a preliminary version of a personal portfolio, with an About Me page (index.html), a Contact page (contact.html) and a portfolio where my future projects will be linked (portfolio.html).  At this time, the portfolio displays placeholder images and text, and the Contact page is designed but not yet functional.  This project allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills.  I learned a number of new skills, including positioning text over images, and creating a sticky footer.
