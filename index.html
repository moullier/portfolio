        <p>My name is Maria Francis-Moullier, and I am enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp in order to learn web development in order to start a career in that field.  I have always liked working with computers.  In my undergraduate career, I studied Computer Science and Political Science.  In my Computer Science classes, I learned some C and Java programming.  Now I'm excited to gain new skills and work with more modern platforms.</p>

        <p>Most recently, I worked at Intuit for 8 years, in the TurboTax and QuickBooks Online departments.  I did a lot of data analysis work, using Excel, Access and SQL to develop new metrics and report out to management on customer pain.  My team was able to synthesize data from a number of different sources to create insights that had not previously been available.  I also worked on the QuickBooks Online Defect team, taking reports of bugs in the code that came in to front line support and processing them for the developers to fix. My duties included training customer support agents at various locations around the country.</p>
